Try typing only the first word or two of your school name (instead of the whole thing at once) and wait to see if a match appears in the results.2. Try abbreviating or unabbreviating. If \"St. Mary's\" doesn't work, try \"Saint Mary's\" or vice versa. Same with JFK vs. John F. Kennedy.3. Make sure you are searching for a specific school, not a whole district.4. Use “&” instead of “and” and vice versa. You can also try taking out or adding in periods, sometimes “J. F. Kennedy Jr. Middle School” won’t work, but “J F Kennedy Middle School will.5. Try removing a name or initial. For example, “Robert E. Lee High School” might not show up, but “Lee High School” will.6. Try taking out or adding words like “High”, “Middle”, and “Senior”. “William S. Hart Senior High School” might not work, but “Hart High School” will and vice versa.7. If your school is in a U.S. territory, please click the “Contact Us” link below and send us your school’s name and location to sign up."
