That's it!

If this is the first time you ran "vagrant up", follow these steps to
finish building your environment:

1. Run "vagrant ssh" from this directory.
2. When complete, run "cd /vagrant && sh build.sh"

Your environment will be available at localhost:8888.

Please note: The initial administrator account is created by the build.sh
script.  Look for a line along the lines of this:

"Installation complete.  User name: admin  User password: xxxxx"
